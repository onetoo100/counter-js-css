# counter-js-css
Simple counter project using just Javascript and a little bit of CSS.

The project check the buttons and call a function that will increase, decrease or just reset the value, it will also change the value's color;

Important concepts covered in this project:

      document.querySelector();
      document.querySelectorAll();

I could use document.querySelector(), but to train I created a foreach to check all the buttons on the screen and get their classList.
I implemented a ternary operator with multiple conditions, also for training.
In CSS I used flexBox to center the buttons with 'space-around' and for the colors I tried using the color palette on the adobe page.
